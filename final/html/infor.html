    &nbsp&nbsp Rummikub is a tile-based game that was created in the 1930s by Ephraim Hertzano, a Romanian-born Jew who immigrated to Mandate Palestine (now Israel) in the 1940s. Hertzano developed the game as a way to help his children learn math and thinking skills. The game quickly became popular and was eventually marketed worldwide, winning numerous awards and becoming one of the most popular tile-based games in the world.

    &nbsp&nbsp Rummikub is a game for 2 to 4 players and is played with 106 tiles. The tiles are numbered 1 to 13 in four colors (red, blue, yellow, and black) and there are two jokers. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your tiles by forming sets and runs. At the beginning of the game, each player draws 14 tiles and places them on their rack. The remaining tiles are placed face down in the center of the table to form the pool. The first player must play a set or run of at least three tiles on the table, and then play continues clockwise around the table. A set is three or four tiles of the same number but different colors, and a run is three or more consecutive tiles of the same color. Jokers can be used as any tile to complete a set or run. Once a player has played their tiles, they draw one tile from the pool and play passes to the next player. If a player cannot play on their turn, they must draw one tile from the pool and their turn ends. The game ends when a player has played all their tiles, and the remaining players count the value of their remaining tiles. The player with the lowest total value of remaining tiles is the winner.
